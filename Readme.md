# Plugin Architecture for a Trading Application

This project demonstrates how to implement a **plugin architecture** in a trading application. The architecture allows dynamic user interfaces for different types of users by using plugins. Instead of hardcoding logic for each user type, we use a flexible, modular approach, making the system easier to maintain, extend, and scale.

## Introduction

In this project, the **Plugin Architecture** is applied to handle various user types within a trading application. Typically, developers might use conditional logic to handle different user scenarios, but as the project grows, this becomes hard to maintain. Plugin architecture provides a cleaner solution by separating concerns and allowing new features to be added as independent modules.

## Features

- Modular architecture using plugins
- Dynamically render user-specific views
- Easier code maintenance and scalability
- Clean separation of logic with the use of protocols and extensions

## Installation

To run this project:

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/codedeman/PluginArchitecture.git
    ```

2. Open the project in Xcode:

    ```bash
    open PluginArchitecture.xcodeproj
    ```

3. Build and run the app in a simulator or on a device.

## Usage

1. **Plugin Definition**: Define a plugin by conforming to the `Plugin` protocol. Each plugin will have an associated view that will be dynamically rendered.

    ```swift
    protocol Plugin: Identifiable {
        associatedtype PluginView: View
        var id: UUID { get }
        var name: String { get }
        var imageName: String { get }
        @ViewBuilder func render() -> PluginView
    }
    ```

2. **Sample Plugin**: Create plugins that handle different user use cases.

    ```swift
    struct SamplePlugin: Plugin {
        let id = UUID()
        let name: String
        let imageName: String
        
        func render() -> some View {
            VStack {
                Image(systemName: imageName)
                Text(name)
            }
        }
    }
    ```

3. **Host View**: The `PluginHostView` will handle displaying the plugins in a horizontal or vertical layout.

    ```swift
    struct PluginHostView: View {
        var shortcuts: [AnyPlugin] // Horizontal list
        var verticalPlugins: [AnyPlugin] // Vertical list
        
        var body: some View {
            VStack {
                ScrollView(.horizontal) {
                    HStack {
                        ForEach(shortcuts) { plugin in
                            plugin.render()
                        }
                    }
                }
                LazyVGrid(columns: [GridItem(.flexible()), GridItem(.flexible())]) {
                    ForEach(verticalPlugins) { plugin in
                        plugin.render()
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
    ```

## Architecture

The plugin architecture is based on the following principles:

- **Plugins**: Encapsulate the user-specific logic and view rendering.
- **Protocol-Oriented**: Define a `Plugin` protocol that all user-specific modules conform to.
- **Dynamic Layout**: Use `ScrollView` for horizontal lists and `LazyVGrid` for vertical lists.

### API Design

If plugins are loaded from an API, the following sample API response format is suggested:

```json
{
    "plugins": [
        {
            "name": "Marketplace",
            "image": "cart",
            "type": "vertical"
        },
        {
            "name": "Friends",
            "image": "person.2",
            "type": "horizontal"
        }
    ]
}
```

Plugins will be dynamically created based on API responses.

## Plugin Examples

Here are some examples of plugins:

- **Friends Plugin**: Displays a list of friends.
- **Marketplace Plugin**: Shows a marketplace for trading.
- **Professional Dashboard Plugin**: Renders a dashboard for professionals.
